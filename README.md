# Vikings

2D Vikings game

### Network

Server uses both TCP and UDP

TCP is used to validate and do the login to all the users that want to get into the game.
The server will determine if the user should enter or not into the world.

***For now the authentication is based on the username***

UDP will be used to send all the information about all other users that are playing inside the world.
